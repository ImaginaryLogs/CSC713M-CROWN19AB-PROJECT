# Theoretical Framework

For this part, it is assumed that we will be working default with Random Forest Model, but it can be any model.

Since there can be a variety of free-variables that can be attached to the Model, we can just treat it the preprocessed data set as the LAST NAME and the first name can be anything (default is greek alphabet).

For example: MODEL 1-ALPHA AMBER, MODEL 1-ALPHA BENNETTE, MODEL 2-BETA XINGQU, ETC...

This is more to uniquely identify models and datasets.
