# Theoretical Framework

For this part, we ought to explore the space WITHIN feature groups, then OUTSIDE feature groups.

This is so that we can assess how one component is related to another, and get a better idea of the distribution of the features.

For this, I recommend having separate ipynbs for WITHIN and OUTSIDE feature groups.

Then, we can summarize by outputting in a markdown somewhere within this folder.
