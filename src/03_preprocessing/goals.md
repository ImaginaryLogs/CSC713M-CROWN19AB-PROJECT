# Theoretical Framework

For preprocessing, we need to identify what features to select first and label them. For example, the first attempt may include just amino-acid data, but then a second attempt may include PROTBERT.

Different feature combinations may produce different outcomes, so its best to include them as a gigantic dataset first, then have a program that outputs the desired one.

Thus, its best to take note what is being experimentally looked into.

For example,
    MODEL-1 FEB-2: 3-Kmers Motifs and Composition.
    MODEL-2 FEB-5: PROTBERT.
