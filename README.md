# CoV-AbDab Machine Learning Model

> CSC713M (MSINTSY) T2 2025-2026

A machine learning model project designed to identifying neutralizing and binding status of antibody proteins.

By the Alphafold Cooking Lab Group (G01 MSINTSY)

## Proposal

### Justification

Traditional laboratory experiments for protein analysis require immense time and cost, so accelerating the scientific process enables faster breakthroughs in life-saving areas like drug-discovery. Producing Machine Learning models like these help democratize bioinformatics resources, so that those countries who have weak spending on to biomedical research can also utilize and participate in analysis proteins through just computers.
